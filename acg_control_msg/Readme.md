# acg_control_msg

This package includes the action definition needed for the communication of a trajectory in the operational space through action. The action definition depends on the `workspace_trajectory_msgs` package.

For the time being it defines the `FollowWorkspaceTrajectory.action` action which allows to send and monitor the execution of a workspace trajectory.
