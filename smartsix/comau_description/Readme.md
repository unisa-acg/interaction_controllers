# comau_description

This package contains the xacro and mesh files of Comau Smart-Six robot.

The `robot` directory contains the following xacro files:

* `smartsix.xacro` contains the robot model. This description is generated using the SolidWorks 3D CAD software, the CAD files provided by Comau and the `sw_urdf_exporter` plugin. Starting with the description file generated by SolidWorks 3D, rotation axes have been added for each joint, since they are set to zero by default. In addition, dynamic tag values and joint limits have been added. The `smartsix.xacro` file is used to generate the SRDF and other utility files by MoveIt! Setup Assistant;

* `smartsix.gazebo.xacro` contains the Gazebo tags used to specify additional properties needed for the Gazebo simulation;

* `smartsix.urdf.xacro` includes `smartsix.xacro` and `smartsix.gazebo.xacro`;

* `ft_sensor_tool.xacro` contains the model of a force/torque sensor and adds the Gazebo force/torque sensor;

* `smartsix_with_ft_sensor.xacro` includes `smartsix.urdf.xacro` and the `ft_sensor_tool.xacro`.

The `meshes` directory contains collision and visual objects. Visual objects include .dae (COLLADA) meshes, used in the URDF visual tags, while collision objects include .stl meshes used in the URDF collision tags.
