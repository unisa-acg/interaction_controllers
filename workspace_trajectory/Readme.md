# workspace_trajectory

This package contains the `WorkspaceTrajectory` class which offers several functionalities to generate and manipulate workspace trajectories before/after being transformed into/from messages that nodes exchange.

## Dependencies

This package depends on the `workspace_trajectory_msgs` package for `WorkspaceTrajectory` message definition.

The `WorkspaceTrajectory` class differs from the `WorkspaceTrajectory` message in that the former provides greater functionalities than the latter.
